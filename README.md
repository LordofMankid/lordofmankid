# Hey! I'm Clarence. 

I’m a recent Tufts University graduate and full-stack developer with a B.S. in Computer Science based in the Boston area. I'm most excited by roles for mission-driven startups and nonprofits. Check out my portfolio [here](https://www.clarence-yeh.dev/)

## What am I up to?

### Freebites
I'm the Co-Founder of Freebites, an iOS (soon on Android!) app that focuses on connecting college students to free food opportunities on campus. My team and I are currently hard at work, launching at universities like Harvard and Northeastern, with a few more on the way. 

Stay posted on [my blog](https://www.clarence-yeh.dev/blogs) for the day-to-day journey of everything I'm learning so far.

### YouTube 
I'm not terribly active on YouTube, but I also studied film in university; video creation is one of my hobbies! My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@itsclarence7685) features some of my best work, both about coding and also just general life.
